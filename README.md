# 12Choose3
Choose cards from set of 12 until 3 matches are chosen. There are 'Doubles' available.

This is the bonus round to a free game for a typical slot machine. There are 12 cards of varying "levels' as well as 3 'Double' cards. The game continues until 3 matching cards are chosen. If 3 doubles have been chosen before 3 matches are chosen, the prize is doubled. The script returns the probability of winning each level. The probabilites are separated from the probability of winning each of these levels as well as the double award.
